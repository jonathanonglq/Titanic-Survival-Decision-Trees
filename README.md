# Titanic Survival Probability
## Quick Summary
In this project, we focus primarily on predicting the probability of survival of passengers who were onboard the Titanic. Here, explore a wide range of predictive models, namely simple decision trees, logistic regression, random forest regression, and gradient boosting techniques. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to optimize certain parameters of the decision tree models. Another major aspect of the project is its focus on data manipulation techniques, ranging from data imputation to feature engineering. As described in the notebook, these have significant impact on the predictive accuracy of models.
